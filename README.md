# LEGO-MINDSTORMS-Voice-Challenge
LEGO MINDSTORMS Voice Challenge repository

This is a repository to share the code developed for both the Alexa  and the Lego Mindstorm project parts.

There are two main folders: alexa and lego
In alexa folder you may find:
  - the lambda function that is Alexa-Hosted Skill
  - the skill definition json

In lego folder you will find:
  - python lego brick code

A third folder contains two videos that demonstrate the functionality:
  - movement video demonstrates that you can ask the robot to move forward, backwards, left and right, set different speed and detect and eliminate enemies. https://github.com/avperez80/LEGO-MINDSTORMS-Voice-Challenge/blob/master/videos/RobotHammer_movement.mov?raw=true
  - patrol video demonstrates that the robot knows his position and do not move out of the orange 6 steps square, detecting threads and eliminating them. https://github.com/avperez80/LEGO-MINDSTORMS-Voice-Challenge/blob/master/videos/RobotHammer_patrol.mov?raw=true
